A journalist conducting a survey on how often people indulged in sex decided to start her assignment with pilots, since they were the most notorious for philandering.
 She asks a pilot "When was the last time you made love". He replies "Nineteen Fifty Nine". She says "that is an awful lot of time". The pilot replies "yeh, it is twenty one ten already" glancing at his watch.
