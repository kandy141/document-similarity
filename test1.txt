Alcohol, Air-Conditioning and Adjustments
The verdict is in. Students want a change in the convocation gown. A whopping 479 out of the 582 voters have voted for a full body black coat and cape while just 3 voters have voted to retain the gown. Monday Morning decided to show the poll results to Director Sir, along with a few pressing issues from the past and a few firsts in the future.
MM: There was some police activity at the previously closed gate. What is NIT’s stand? Will the Nit market be demolished?
DD: The entire NIT boundary has 4 designated openings, the 5th; a 22m gap has to be closed. Due to vested interests to not to have it closed, we could not have the construction. There were threats and stone pelting, thus we approached the police and 3rd March was the day decided under the protection of police that the wall is built. After the wall is built, there will be an electricity substation at the location, which will help us to bring in 33kV supply from a distance of 10 km. The present 11kV supply of the whole campus is being converted into a bigger and reliable 33kV network. I have no idea about the market, we only secured our boundary. The Institute wants in its proximity a well developed legally constructed series of shops. We are uncomfortable having unauthorised illegal shops in the vicinity because, having Coca-Cola bottles in front, they are selling alcohol behind. Selling alcohol is no crime unless you don’t hold licence, but in the proximity of an institute, it is not permitted.  I don’t do tremendous monitoring over alcohol consumption of reasonably grown up people, but we cannot entertain sale of alcohol at an illegal joint. Huge fractions of my students are below the legal drinking age of 21. Drinking in the room is not allowed, but I do not deploy police to find out if you are drinking in your room because it will scare students and harm the good corporate growing environment of the institute. Providing security is my responsibility and security comes at a certain sacrifice of freedom, but if I overdo to an extent that students get suffocated under control, then their personality will not grow and they won’t get employment. If at the age of 22, you are protected every moment, then how will you protect other people! One bottle of whisky doesn’t bother me, but a crate of such bottles does, as it may increase the probability of major issues. Thus the security at main gate is enhanced and the practice discouraged. This is one of the primary reasons why the gate was desired open, by vested interests of outsiders. Also my security, under their pressure and fear, was reporting to them, not to me. If the market outside the old gate fears loss of business, then we could preferentially buy a lot of mess demands from them, provided they give us at market rates. Every student and faculty wanted the gate to be open, but I was the only person not in favour, because security of the campus is not the responsibility of individuals, but the management.
MM: We hear that there are prospects of a supermarket inside the campus.
DD: Yes there is a proposal. But having a market inside the campus, which exceeds the potential to support the internal population, attracts undesired population from outside. Any internal facility should be below the requirement; it should trail the demand, not lead. 
MM: Polling on convocation gown design reads 82.3 %( 479 out of 582) of students in favour of black long coat with hat, while just 0.5% people want to retain the old design.
DD: The decision will be taken in favour of the people who want the change. We will expose the possibility of either procuring or renting, which is difficult. I have taken it seriously, we are examining, but presently I assure nothing.
MM: Can you throw some light on the air-conditioning project going on in campus? What is the construction going on behind PPA?
DD: Imported centrifugal compressors have reached Kolkata port. I’m hopeful that by August, BBA will be completely air-conditioned, but rest of the campus will take up to next March. During renovation of the AV hall we did the low side, that is, internal structure of air-conditioning; in anticipation, even before we conceived the idea of central air-conditioning .The high side being the provision of chilled water that will cause the cooling effect. Behind PPA is the central AC Plant coming up, whose completion is a 10 year plan. Refrigeration is measured in tonnes of refrigeration (TR) according to which 3.5kW of heat liberation consumes approximately 1.4 units of electricity. Pumps, compressors and chillers will be required to circulate water at 6 degree, which will return at 11degree, after being circulated through big pipelines, around the campus. Chilled water will enter into rooms, and heat exchangers will take away the room’s heat. So this is the plan for ground floor, and 1st floor will be a large hall for student’s activity and upon that will be the cooling tower. But according to proposal, one third of the project will be done now; another one third will take a year or two, while the last third will be accomplished in 5 or 7 years.
MM: Students are expecting CCD outlet inside campus, according to your prior information of their opening by December.
DD: But CCD is not expecting the students! We wrote to them, their requirements are made available, but they are not responding. Previously they showed interest, but due to some internal politics of CCD they are reluctant to start up in campus. Now we are thinking of another proposal given by the present Rengcol proprietor, to convert the 1st floor into a restaurant. There is another proposal from a local hotel management graduate, who will be giving the idea in written to Prof. Ray and his committee, and they will decide on a new provision at the Calorie.
MM: School of management takes in only B.Tech students. Why is that a necessary criterion for our Institute’s MBA admission procedure?
DD: It is a negative criterion. It should not happen, but is happening because we have faculty with less experience of dealing with students from vivid background, thus we limit the entry to a narrow zone of people from past background. It’s not intended to be the permanent criterion; it was a necessity of starting of the department. Homogeneous background makes selection of electives and other subjects easier. But it is not intended to be the character of the course.
MM: Students are supposed to receive a mail regarding the student’s body formation.
DD: It is half written, when the rest half will be drafted by me, I will put it up on webmail. The details of selection of members and their job functions will be defined in it. 
MM: Shifting of girls from KMS to CVR is proposed to be done on an approximate ratio of 50% from each batch to each of the two hostels, but girls are interested in shifting in batches as a whole.
DD: When not segregated you learn how to live with your batch mates effectively, but you will be misfit to companies which have employees from all batch and ages. It is my duty to teach you how to live in communities of variety. I’m having a prejudice supported by experience and others viewpoints that this is the kind of experience I should give you, else I fail in keeping the promise given to your parents. Education is that which remains after we forget everything learnt in our classroom. Personality comprises of scientific and social parts, more the heterogeneity better the individual. Our ordinary sense of insecurity makes us heard in terms of former school mates, home state, batch or department. It is in the students benefit, an engineer from IIT is doing far better than his counterpart from Padmanava, is partly because in his four years he got exposed to a far better heterogeneous environment. After living together for 3 years, we won’t traumatise them; shifting in a group of up to 5 people will be honoured, but 1st year students will have to go, segregated in a way the boys are done in second and following years. It cannot be a batch wise shifting, as it will not be good for you. As it will be done for the 1st time for girls, we will see to some methods in their interest. 
MM: If the present prefinal year girls are split then the living conditions of single seated rooms of KMS will not be comparable to rooms of CVR.
DD: But then they won’t have an identity crisis of which hall they belonged to. Those who will take a little hardship and stay in KMS will be better off. But I want students to go to CVR, as there are surplus rooms there and KMS is over populated. Comfort is good .Pride is better!
MM: The BBA west wall painting competition and hall poster painting competition results were supposed to be out by 22nd of February, any updates regarding that?
DD:  For BBA, I haven’t found anything up to my satisfaction, on my view point. In the halls there are good designs. Prof. K. C. Pati will be giving the decision soon. I’ll employ some other trick to get some design for BBA wall. The worst thing to do is to buy the design; a little better option is to get it from any faculty of Art University, but best would have been to receive some design from our students.
