{933}{963}Hello, everyone.
{965}{1011}We want to welcome|a very special guest
{1012}{1039}to our park today
{1040}{1085}the president's daughter.
{1087}{1134}Big smile. Big smile.
{1135}{1170}Hello, Alexandra.
{1172}{1198}Where's your father?
{1199}{1242}He'll be here.
{1244}{1303}I'll make sure of it.
{1305}{1360}Well, hey there,|little miss first lady,
{1362}{1428}I'm Dinky Winks, owner|of this fine establishment.
{1430}{1497}You ready to ride the ride|and shrill to the thrills,|spills, and chills?
{1498}{1529}Yes, I am.
{1531}{1578}Right this way!
{1610}{1697}Of course, that behind me...|the world-famous Whippersnapper.
{1698}{1769}- Guaranteed to make|grown men howl
{1771}{1816}- Like a cub woke|at weaning time.
{1818}{1871}Over on our left...
{1884}{1961}The NerveWracker...|oh-ho, painful.
{1982}{2012}Good fun.
{2014}{2054}On your other left
{2056}{2133}is, well,|my personal favorite
{2135}{2164}the Vomiter.
{2166}{2194}Now, we tell people
{2196}{2246}not to ride it|on a full stomach,
{2248}{2284}but you know folks.
{2286}{2345}They just don't listen.
{2378}{2412}But...
{2413}{2464}why bother with any|of those?
{2466}{2531}You're here|for my latest and greatest.
{2533}{2598}For your personal amusement|and complete gratification,
{2600}{2664}I humbly offer...
{2665}{2712}the Juggler.
{2830}{2872}But is it fast?
{2873}{2916}Is it fast?
{2917}{2961}Well, let's see, shall we?
{2963}{3048}The riders are strapped|into the bubble.
{3092}{3189}The hydrobot lifts the bubble|high into the air.
{3236}{3268}And spins it round and round|as fast
{3269}{3358}as the United States government|will allow.
{3440}{3531}The bubble spins, turns,|flips, and bounces.
{3570}{3635}And then... it juggles you.
{3852}{3901}I want to go on!
{3921}{3961}I thought so.
{3963}{4023}Now, understand - the override|precautions are top-notch,
{4025}{4070}modified by yours truly.
{4072}{4112}I thought her father|was supposed to be here.
{4114}{4167}The president|has more pressing business
{4168}{4200}than to spend|an entire Sunday
{4202}{4245}in a theme park.
{4247}{4300}No one's that busy.
{4355}{4401}Have fun, kid.
{4424}{4474}- We'll take it a little slow,
{4476}{4526}just make it fun.
{4795}{4825}Can't you get her down?
{4826}{4870}Somebody's jammed|the override.
{4871}{4943}Why, that|little troublemaker.
{4991}{5037}Remain calm.|Remain calm.
{5039}{5112}We are the Secret Service.|Everything is under control.
{5114}{5154}- There's nothing|we can do, sir.|- What?
{5155}{5201}The weight of our agents|will prevent us from ascending
{5202}{5247}the shaky precipice|on which she now stands.
{5248}{5291}She'll fall.
{5291}{5365}Don't we have|any smaller agents?
{5399}{5478}Bring me agents SK1 and SK2.
{5479}{5556}- Coming through.|- Coming through.
{5709}{5742}We're ready.
{5743}{5793}Use this - the latest gear.
{5795}{5833}We get to keep them|afterwards?
{5835}{5866}- N-No.
{5868}{5892}Yes.
{5894}{5930}Of course.
{5931}{5972}Let's rock.
{6024}{6098}You're sure|they can handle this?
{6130}{6210}If not,|there are two others who can.
{6214}{6296}Bring me agents SK3 and SK4|as backup.
{6362}{6409}We got company.
{6512}{6601}Gary and Gerti...|what are they doing here?
{6981}{7018}Excuse me there, sport.
{7020}{7082}Where did you get that?
{7083}{7129}Latest|in electro-riser technology,
{7131}{7191}with new composite materials|and A.I. brainology.
{7192}{7222}I can see
{7223}{7270}you don't know|what I'm talking about.
{7271}{7318}Gary, this is my rescue.
{7320}{7358}We'll take it from here.
{7360}{7444}"Latest gear," my butt.
{7472}{7505}No, no, no!
{7507}{7571}You'll just make it worse!
{7605}{7639}Now you done it.
{7640}{7681}Over here!
{7683}{7710}Get away from me!
{7712}{7781}Alexandra, take my hand!
{7783}{7811}Back off!
{7813}{7871}I want my father|to come up here and get me.
{7872}{7925}But he's the president|of the United States.
{7927}{7955}No, he's my father.
{7957}{8018}He was my father|before he ever became president,
{8020}{8069}and he should still|be my father now.
{8071}{8110}I want him up here!
{8112}{8150}Sir, we have a situation.
{8151}{8190}She's got the Transmooker.
{8192}{8247}This is now|a code-red situation.
{8248}{8276}Get her down now!
{8277}{8302}The point is,
{8304}{8363}you and your father|need to have a talk.
{8364}{8412}Up here may not be|the best place.
{8414}{8462}Come with me,|and I promise you,
{8464}{8521}- The two of you will have|that talk.
{8523}{8585}How can you promise that?
{8587}{8625}I'm Level 2.
{8627}{8698}I can order him|to talk to you.
{8813}{8845}Hi, Gerti.
{8846}{8886}Whatcha doing?
{8888}{8919}I'm trying to stop the ride.
{8921}{8982}- Without disengaging|the axis?|- Exactly.
{8984}{9030}Then stop what you're doing.
{9031}{9113}You see, the ride|is designed to work|like a giant magnet.
{9115}{9153}If you reverse|the polarization,
{9155}{9236}bye-bye,|president's daughter.
{9373}{9420}See you around.
{9479}{9523}- Okay.
{9525}{9554}Wait.
{9555}{9615}I took this from|my father's office this morning.
{9617}{9658}I'm sure he'll want it back.
{9677}{9711}Careful!
{9713}{9772}Look, Cortez, you take her down,|and I'll take this down.
{9774}{9808}That way, we both look good.
{9809}{9886}I'm not doing this|for looks, Gary.
{10007}{10075}Thank goodness|you're all right, Alexandra.
{10076}{10110}We were worried sick.
{10112}{10163}- Boys.
{10183}{10268}I think this|is what you're looking for.
{10300}{10356}She swiped it|from the president.
{10357}{10417}Oh, you're in big trouble|this time, missy.
{10444}{10474}Wait a minute.
{10476}{10522}I promised her|she could talk to her father.
{10524}{10570}Oh, she'll talk to him,|all right.
{10572}{10633}We'll make sure of that.
{12049}{12123}So, you want|the Ukata assignment, huh?
{12125}{12191}Your duties are assigned|to you by the agency
{12193}{12236}same as everyone,|same as me.
{12237}{12302}I know. It's just|that we've learned so much.
{12304}{12368}Juni and I are more|than capable of taking|bigger assignments.
{12370}{12405}But that's not|your decision to make.
{12407}{12445}The Spy Kids organization|is still new,
{12447}{12488}and if you're a Level 3|or even a Level 2,
{12488}{12553}you cannot|go on a mission alone.
{12555}{12617}You need more experience.
{12627}{12655}Come on.
{12657}{12711}Okay, Mom, if you're looking|for top-secret information,
{12713}{12747}just go straight|to the source.
{12773}{12809}Welcome to the Pentagon.
{12811}{12878}How did you do that?|You can't do that.
{12879}{12912}There is no hacking|in this household.
{12914}{12949}I know. Sorry.
{12951}{13023}Show me that again.
{13101}{13206}I know this hair thing|is one of my weakest points.
{13207}{13240}- Wait one minute.
{13242}{13309}You're gonna look cool.
{13311}{13394}In fact, you're looking cooler,|right? Like me.
{13395}{13438}Like Poppy.
{13439}{13539}And it's kind|of em-o-tion-al to me.
{13540}{13579}You know? Uh-oh.
{13581}{13616}A knot.
{13617}{13664}We are gonna...
{13687}{13711}You...
{13712}{13765}Uh-huh, uh-huh.|We got it.
{13767}{13807}That's my boy.
{13809}{13844}Last touch.
{13845}{13893}Hup, hup.
{13895}{13946}You want me|to tie it for you?
{13948}{14027}No, it's okay.|R.A.L.P.H. can do it.
{14078}{14127}Bow tie, R.A.L.P.H.,
{14129}{14181}and not too tight.
{14463}{14515}Thanks, R.A.L.P.H.
{14591}{14613}Interesting.
{14615}{14638}But...
{14640}{14744}he can never, ever|replace...
{14745}{14784}me.
{14785}{14813}Pow.
{14814}{14839}Not yet, but I think
{14841}{14920}that new upgrade|comes in next week.
{15005}{15066}Only joking.
{15068}{15109}Hey!
{15161}{15201}Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids.
{15204}{15253}Ki
{15255}{15310}Joking?
{15342}{15370}Thank you.
{15372}{15402}Yes, ma'am.
{15403}{15432}Okay. Remember, kids,
{15434}{15497}this is a very important night|for your father.
{15499}{15563}And if he's named director|of the O.S.S.,
{15565}{15622}be sure to stand up|and give him a big hug,
{15624}{15655}all right?
{15657}{15707}What if Dad doesn't win?
{15709}{15785}Well, then,|give him a bigger hug.
{15887}{15920}Oh, Yao Ling, Wa Ling,
{15921}{15968}this is Danielle|and Dione Daluc.
{15970}{16000}- Hello.|- Hi.
{16002}{16081}They created lnfolink, sort of|an online trading system
{16083}{16160}for swapping|international secrets.
{16205}{16244}Hi.
{16246}{16283}Oh, hey.
{16285}{16316}Hello.
{16318}{16338}Champagne?
{16340}{16366}Can't have any of that.
{16367}{16407}Sorry.
{16455}{16527}Something doesn't feel right.
{16529}{16569}No wonder...|your buddy's here
{16571}{16612}your buddy|with the weird laugh.
{16613}{16642}He does not have|a weird laugh.
{16644}{16723}We were just...|talking about you.
{16724}{16759}Really?
{16804}{16851}Wow.|You look great, Carmen.
{16853}{16909}- You want to dance?|- Sure.
{16911}{16968}I don't think that's|a good idea, Gary.
{16970}{17034}Family rules say you need to|ask my father's permission.
{17036}{17101}You know, you should have had|that suit tailored, Juni.
{17103}{17143}It's bunching up|around your gut,
{17144}{17187}and it makes your head|look way too big.
{17188}{17256}You have to excuse|my little brother.
{17258}{17335}He's still a little upset|about the... Juggler incident.
{17337}{17411}A good agent|controls his temper.
{17458}{17495}Just be glad|my dad isn't here.
{17496}{17550}He gets really psycho|about this sort of thing.
{17579}{17621}Hi, Dad.
{17622}{17671}Um, you remember Gary.|He's in our organization.
{17673}{17730}I was just asking your daughter|for a dance.
{17731}{17768}You know how to dance?
{17770}{17794}Fairly well, sir.
{17796}{17823}What kind of dances?
{17825}{17853}All types of dances.
{17855}{17887}- What about tango?|- Yes.
{17889}{17916}- Mambo?|- Fairly well.
{17918}{17945}- Rumba?|- Yes.
{17947}{17973}- Cha-cha-cha?|- Seven steps.
{17975}{17999}- Bossa nova?|- Mm-hmm.
{18001}{18062}- Merengue?|- Of course.
{18157}{18187}What about waltz?
{18189}{18260}Y-Yeah, I can waltz.
{18262}{18299}Show me.
{18352}{18404}Right.
{18568}{18623}Something like that.
{18634}{18692}All right.
{18693}{18748}You can go to dance.
{18849}{18912}Watch your older sister.
{19423}{19447}Alexandra?
{19449}{19471}Yes?
{19473}{19512}What are you doing in there?
{19514}{19555}Dancing.
{19557}{19625}Do you always carry|this many Secret Service around?
{19627}{19671}My dad's idea
{19672}{19754}he's gotten|a little... paranoid.
{19756}{19863}Well, would you dance...|with me?
{19865}{19895}No.
{19926}{19978}All right,|hold on a second, guys.
{19980}{20038}Level 2 - break it up!
{20087}{20128}Why not?
{20168}{20226}I only dance...
{20227}{20262}ballet.
{20293}{20390}What|an incredible coincidence.
{20434}{20472}So do l.
{21182}{21219}Well, Juni, I must say,
{21221}{21289}you're a man|of many talents.
{21399}{21439}One tries.
{21504}{21607}Uh, could you find your seats?|We're ready to start.
{21660}{21710}I must go.
{21853}{21883}- Ladies and gentlemen,
{21885}{21962}the president|of the United States.
{22046}{22086}Thank you.
{22144}{22173}I am proud of the O.S.S.
{22174}{22227}and their newly formed|Spy Kids division.
{22229}{22295}For their outstanding|accomplishments yesterday.
{22297}{22349}Gary and Gerti Giggles
{22350}{22386}not only saved|my daughter...
{22388}{22452}What is he talking about?|I saved her!
{22454}{22483}Juni...
{22485}{22568}But more importantly,|if not most importantly,
{22570}{22648}they safely retrieved|the Transmooker device
{22649}{22711}that my daughter accidentally|took from my office
{22713}{22763}earlier that day.
{22769}{22823}Now it is my great pleasure|to announce
{22825}{22898}the new director|of the O.S.S...
{22929}{22971}Gregor
{23058}{23114}... Donnagon Giggles.
{23329}{23368}Gary and Gerti Giggles
{23370}{23405}are the kind of agents|we need
{23407}{23467}to turn the O.S.S. around.
{23469}{23524}I am proud to award them
{23526}{23616}- These Level 1 badges,
{23618}{23719}- What?|- Which will enable them|to take on real missions,
{23721}{23788}something challenging,|like the Ukata assignment.
{23790}{23824}Yes!
{23826}{23905}- I wanted that assignment.|This is so unfair.
{23907}{23962}I am proud to claim them
{23964}{24043}as our organization's|top Spy Kid operatives!
{24045}{24076}Something's not right.
{24078}{24108}And I'm also proud
{24110}{24180}to claim them, of course,
{24182}{24229}as my children.
{24230}{24260}This is all wrong.
{24261}{24314}To our Spy Kids.
{24316}{24357}- To our Spy Kids.|- To our Spy Kids.|- To our Spy Kids.
{24358}{24407}To our Spy Kids.
{24710}{24745}This...
{25016}{25072}Secure the perimeter!
{25086}{25113}Sleepers.
{25114}{25205}They're after|the Transmooker device!
{25617}{25661}Take'em down.
{25865}{25912}- Pull!|- Pull!
{27161}{27210}Get off, squirt.
{27318}{27370}Give me that back!
{29331}{29399}- You all right, sir?|- Yeah.
{29459}{29494}Come here!
{29496}{29552}Juni, get off of him!
{29678}{29729}No, no. They took|the Transmooker device!
{29731}{29805}They took|the Transmooker device!
{30367}{30439}- The following|Spy Kid cadets
{30441}{30504}please report to the psychic|abilities seminar
{30506}{30582}- Mike Cardenas|and Daniel Duluth.
{30654}{30700}- It's my turn, too.|- Are you sure?
{30702}{30770}All right, your last name is?
{30867}{30910}Hold on a second.
{30912}{30958}I had the Transmooker|in my hand,
{30959}{30986}but you know Juni
{30987}{31035}he wanted to claim it|for himself.
{31036}{31096}- Okay, that should do it.|Thank you, son.|- Right.
{31098}{31189}If that Transmooker device|falls into the wrong hands...
{31190}{31226}we're doomed.
{31228}{31282}Thank you, Mr. President.|That'll be all.
{31284}{31319}We're doomed!
{31319}{31372}Understood, sir.
{31891}{31926}Here.
{32265}{32330}"Floop's Fooglie"...
{32331}{32402}Starring Minion...
{32404}{32461}and Carmenita...
{32568}{32612}Thanks.
{32832}{32891}I was fired.
{32893}{32924}I know.
{32926}{32986}I hacked|into the O.S.S. data files
{32988}{33036}and saw the news.
{33037}{33089}It was probably my fault,|I suppose.
{33090}{33143}I'm sorry.
{33144}{33198}Well, I guess that's that.
{33200}{33288}Let's go to the tree house.|I got an idea.
{33347}{33382}I guess|I could always set up
{33384}{33465}a small detective agency|out here or something.
{33467}{33522}You're thinking|small again, Juni.
{33524}{33578}The old tree house
{33580}{33640}needs another helicopter pad.
{33642}{33725}It needs a paint job,|is what it needs.
{33935}{33982}Your name?
{33983}{34061}Carmen Elizabeth Juanita|Echo Sky Brava Cortez.
{34063}{34097}- Your name?
{34099}{34173}Juni Rocket Racer|Rebelde Cortez.
{34375}{34404}You know...
{34406}{34472}I'm kind of looking forward|to retirement,
{34474}{34583}get back to all the projects|and dreams I left behind.
{34585}{34645}Oh, stop it, Juni.
{34722}{34780}Look, do you want|your job back or not?
{34782}{34837}That's right...|reinstated Level 2.
{34839}{34910}So now we can get back|the missing Transmooker.
{34911}{34942}How?
{35238}{35309}Looks like Gary and Gerti|are about to get briefed
{35310}{35345}on the Ukata assignment.
{35347}{35402}We should listen in.
{35444}{35494}Is R.A.L.P.H. still|at your office?
{35496}{35573}If they haven't|cleaned it out yet.
{35811}{35874}R.A.L.P.H.,|get to the briefing room.
{35876}{35959}We need you to spy|on Gary and Gerti.
{35961}{36025}Make sure no one sees you.
{36951}{37023}- There is|a Bermuda Triangle of sorts
{37024}{37056}off the coast|of Madagascar.
{37056}{37100}As you may remember,|this is an area
{37101}{37178}where some of our O.S.S. cargo|ships have been disappearing.
{37180}{37211}Good boy, R.A.L.P.H.
{37213}{37250}The survivors|of these disappearances
{37252}{37315}tell delusional tales
{37317}{37393}of a mysterious island|populated by strange creatures.
{37395}{37480}Obviously, no land mass|is located anywhere near there,
{37482}{37559}- So these tales were|dismissed, and the agents fired.
{37561}{37593}However...
{37595}{37658}the magnet ship that captured|the Transmooker device
{37660}{37753}was last seen|in this same area.
{37755}{37799}So, we need a small ship,
{37801}{37854}piloted by two small agents
{37855}{37901}to go in and take|a closer look.
{37902}{37973}If you find anything|out of the ordinary,
{37975}{38013}you return,
{38015}{38058}you report it back here.
{38060}{38091}- We accept.|- We accept.
{38093}{38122}You bet we accept.
{38141}{38214}Come home, R.A.L.P.H.|Good work.
{38221}{38256}It's a great assignment,
{38258}{38325}but Gary and Gerti have it,|and I'm fired.
{38326}{38382}And I'm reassigning you|to the O.S.S.
{38384}{38445}- Don't tell me|you're hacking into|- Already done.
{38472}{38495}Level 2 status
{38497}{38556}reinstated.
{38558}{38595}Carmen, you can't do this.
{38597}{38669}I already did it.|I'd take it one step further.
{38671}{38724}We're assigning ourselves|to the Ukata assignment.
{38725}{38802}I'm programming a new|destination for Gary and Gerti.
{38804}{38878}Now, that,|I got to be a part of.
{38977}{39021}State your name, please.
{39023}{39073}Gary Giggles.
{39075}{39118}Access denied.
{39120}{39181}It knows you're not him.
{39211}{39251}Confirmed.
{39295}{39337}New destination?
{39339}{39382}How about...
{39383}{39427}Gobi Desert?
{39429}{39454}Stop it, Juni.
{39454}{39486}What?
{39487}{39543}Don't want your boyfriend|to go so far away?
{39545}{39569}He's not my boyfriend.
{39571}{39607}Okay, then.
{39609}{39643}Destination confirmed.
{39645}{39684}There.|What did we just do again?
{39686}{39730}We're gonna get|the Transmooker device back
{39732}{39770}so we can clear your name.
{39772}{39806}We just have to solve|the case
{39807}{39854}before anybody finds out|what we're up to.
{39855}{39914}Are you with me?
{39916}{39948}Okay.
{39948}{39994}Then let's go.
{40171}{40230}- Hello?
{40280}{40354}Hello?
{40356}{40397}- Hey, what are you doing|up there?
{40399}{40442}Sorry, we thought|you were somebody else.
{40443}{40467}Who gave you a key?
{40469}{40554}Did you forget|who built you this place?
{40583}{40639}Come down from there.
{40770}{40823}I brought you|all-new gadgets.
{40825}{40887}Check it out...|the very latest spy watch
{40888}{40921}total communication center,
{40923}{40958}right there on your wrist.
{40960}{41021}Cellphone, lnternet access,|satellite TV
{41023}{41060}you name it.
{41061}{41108}That baby will do|everything but tell|you what time it is.
{41110}{41146}It doesn't tell time?
{41147}{41206}No, there was so much|stuffed into it,
{41208}{41249}there was no more room|for the clock.
{41251}{41283}Cool.
{41284}{41315}Are you sure these are new?
{41317}{41361}We can't be running around|with outdated equipment.
{41363}{41418}Close your eyes|and hold out your wrist.
{41419}{41458}I'm gonna give you
{41460}{41538}the one gadget|you should always carry.
{41539}{41587}A rubber band?
{41588}{41636}No, it's|a Machete elastic wonder.
{41638}{41676}- It's a rubber band.
{41678}{41744}Yeah, but it's also|the world's greatest gadget
{41746}{41804}999 uses...
{41805}{41838}and the important thing
{41840}{41923}is you have to figure out|what those uses are... with this.
{41925}{41952}He's right.
{41954}{42015}Use number one...|a stylish bracelet.
{42016}{42066}Use number two...
{42129}{42208}I'm gonna make a fortune|with these.
{42384}{42437}Are you sure|this is going to work?
{42439}{42469}Just be cool.
{42470}{42554}As far as anybody knows,|you're back on the force.
{42556}{42606}Hey, Uncle Felix.
{42629}{42676}I'm not your uncle.
{42677}{42720}I know. It's just easier|to call you that.
{42722}{42770}Um, you don't mind, do you?
{42772}{42819}Of course not.
{42850}{42891}Well, welcome back, Juni.
{42893}{42941}Says here|you were reinstated.
{42943}{42990}Sure does, doesn't it?
{42991}{43038}He was fired and rehired|all in the same day.
{43040}{43068}Okay.
{43069}{43164}Let me bring up the keys|to the DragonSpy Five.
{43178}{43220}Cake.
{43222}{43262}6 o'clock.
{43356}{43420}Wow. You're looking good|with the new gear, Carmen.
{43422}{43488}- Their latest stuff.|- Very cool...
{43490}{43536}only we had that weeks ago.
{43537}{43588}Here's what's really new.
{43590}{43626}Nanotechnology
{43628}{43731}everything you're wearing|is right here on my wrist.
{43733}{43807}It's superaccurate|and, so light.
{43816}{43851}It even tells time.
{43853}{43890}How did you get that?
{43892}{43923}Well, it's all prototype,|Juni.
{43925}{43976}You can't be running|around with those|mass-produced gadgets.
{43978}{44010}Just means|everyone's got them.
{44012}{44060}I always go|with the prototype.
{44062}{44109}- Sure,|they're a little... buggy,
{44110}{44144}But I can deal.
{44145}{44214}I-I accidentally|squashed him
{44216}{44264}on my way|out of the O.S.S. building.
{44290}{44322}Sorry about that.
{44323}{44381}He was outdated, anyway,
{44382}{44458}so think of it|as a mercy killing.
{44514}{44550}Gary and Gerti Giggles,
{44551}{44617}- You have assignment|SElKJu9.
{44619}{44659}Good luck.
{44681}{44747}Don't hurt yourselves|with that outdated gear.
{44749}{44849}Remember, an agent|is only as good as his gadgets.
{44868}{44896}What?
{44897}{44948}You have|the Ukata assignment?
{44950}{45002}Very nice.
{45004}{45051}You'll love it.
{45140}{45195}Thanks, Uncle Felix.
{45217}{45287}I'm not your uncle.
{45423}{45491}Oh, nice sub.
{45493}{45579}Welcome|to the DragonSpy DLX...
{45581}{45640}Seems like they get|more and more sophisticated
{45641}{45673}each month.
{45674}{45724}Everything is automated!
{45726}{45787}- Now picking your nose.
{45849}{45905}Ugh, little brothers.
{46050}{46145}Let's check our lunchboxes|for mission updates.
{46511}{46555}Sorry, R.A.L.P.H.
{46557}{46631}- You were the best spy|on the force.
{46633}{46695}Juni, leave it alone.|He's dead.
{46696}{46744}Thanks to your buddy Gary.
{46745}{46777}It was an accident.
{46779}{46847}You like him and believe him?
{46858}{46928}I don't like him...|that much.
{47101}{47164}Gary's a bad guy, Carmen.
{47165}{47217}Maybe I know that.
{47217}{47263}I think I can change him.
{47265}{47330}I do not understand you.
{47332}{47378}And you never will.
{47380}{47427}- French fry, sir?
{47429}{47473}Uh! Ow!
{47474}{47515}Gimme that!
{47614}{47714}- Strange - tales|of a mysterious island,
{47716}{47781}disappearing ships,|mysterious creatures,
{47783}{47836}and yet,|no information anywhere
{47838}{47887}on the O.S.S. cargo|or the magnet ship.
{47889}{47939}What's Donnagon doing there?
{47941}{47991}He wasn't|O.S.S. director yet.
{47993}{48047}These are old O.S.S. secrets.
{48048}{48148}And I know just the person|we can call for advice.
{48176}{48212}Who?
{48215}{48269}# Who? #
{48270}{48317}# What? #
{48319}{48371}# When? #
{48373}{48423}# Where? #
{48425}{48461}- # Who? #|- # What? #|- # When? #
{48463}{48495}- # Where? #|- # And why? #
{48497}{48525}# I delight in #
{48527}{48595}- # What... #|- # Do I intend to find? #|- # Find #
{48597}{48629}# This time? #
{48631}{48654}- # Run around! #|- # Jumping down! #
{48656}{48686}# Bounce and bound and... #
{48688}{48717}# Find another way|to duck and hide #
{48719}{48742}# This isle of... #
{48743}{48798}# Dreams #
{48926}{48965}Hello?
{48967}{48998}Yes.
{48999}{49055}- One moment, please.
{49094}{49127}Cut!
{49245}{49304}Who is it again?
{49340}{49421}- Juni Cortez!
{49422}{49464}- What can I do for you?
{49466}{49518}I mean,|you've done so much for me.
{49520}{49553}Your robot counterparts
{49555}{49611}are the surprise|hit characters of my show!
{49613}{49653}Say hello.
{49655}{49714}- # Hello #|- # Hello #
{49731}{49799}Actually, Carmen wants|a word with Mr. Minion.
{49801}{49858}Oh. He's right here.
{50014}{50065}Minion is practicing|a 4-part harmony.
{50067}{50134}- You have one minute.
{50237}{50268}Bueno?
{50270}{50310}How you doing, Minion?
{50312}{50377}Things are a little Floopy|around here for my taste,
{50378}{50427}but it's a living.
{50429}{50487}I need some information|on your favorite subject
{50489}{50519}the O.S.S.
{50521}{50551}I need to make a call.
{50552}{50619}Okay, you ready?
{50620}{50653}Ukata...
{50654}{50703}Transmooker...
{50705}{50749}- The president's|daughter is unavailable.
{50751}{50774}Manage.
{50775}{50805}Press "1" to record.
{50807}{50840}- Mean anything to you?
{50841}{50927}Smells like the work|of Donnagon Giggles.
{50948}{50995}He had first contact|with the Transmooker technology.
{50997}{51048}You think Donnagon's the one|behind all this?
{51050}{51100}You're talking|to a man with four heads.
{51102}{51139}Trust me...|the guy is dirt.
{51140}{51177}What should we look for?
{51179}{51232}First, find the island.
{51233}{51291}Then find the Island Man.
{51293}{51338}That would have been|Donnagon's contact.
{51340}{51363}Okay.
{51365}{51394}Thanks, Minion.
{51396}{51447}Be a good girl|and swat your brother for me.
{51449}{51490}Oh, I will.
{51549}{51588}Something's wrong!|Take the wheel!
{51590}{51637}Got to go.|Good luck!
{51638}{51698}Slow down! We're nearing|destination zone.
{51700}{51762}The radius where all|the disappearances occurred|is right...
{51787}{51819}Here!
{51909}{51950}We've been shut down!
{51951}{52023}- Hold onto something!
{52285}{52377}All power is off...|even the emergency power.
{52408}{52459}My flashlight|doesn't even work.
{52461}{52520}We're stuck, aren't we?
{52549}{52607}Let's get out of here.
{52630}{52687}Rebreathers.
{52689}{52732}Rebreathers.
{52732}{52776}You got to do it by hand.
{52777}{52817}What next?
{52859}{52922}- Nope. Hand, Carmen.
{53024}{53065}Unbelievable.
{53066}{53119}Low-tech!
{53278}{53319}Here we go.
{53938}{54011}Should we travel light|or heavy?
{54011}{54058}We may not be coming|back down here.
{54059}{54116}Let's go heavy.
{54118}{54167}Inflate-a-suits?
{54169}{54233}We don't have much choice.
{54317}{54378}At least the masks work.
{54385}{54469}I think it's because|they're valve-operated,|not electrical-based.
{54471}{54505}It's so strange.
{54507}{54552}Good luck.
{54554}{54591}You too!
{54591}{54635}Stay close!
{55142}{55205}Ugh. great.
{55206}{55240}I'm fat!
{55242}{55281}Was it supposed to do this?
{55283}{55338}It has an electrical|automatic shutoff
{55339}{55374}which didn't work.
{55376}{55453}Luckily, we ran out of air|before the suits exploded.
{55455}{55523}Well, we can still laugh.
{55525}{55567}At what?
{55569}{55656}At whatever you can imagine|Gary and Gerti are doing
{55658}{55707}right about now.
{55941}{55972}Gerti, where are we?
{55974}{56009}Well...
{56009}{56056}according|to my coordinates,
{56058}{56099}- We are...
{56099}{56142}I think that
{56336}{56396}Camel poop!
{56424}{56492}Someone's gonna pay!
{56494}{56545}Cordezes...
{56670}{56704}I like your new office.
{56706}{56762}It's smaller... cozy.
{56764}{56846}Especially... smaller.
{56916}{56956}So many successful missions.
{56958}{56997}Amazing, isn't it?
{56998}{57036}Remember this one?
{57038}{57089}Oh. Which mission is that?
{57091}{57134}- Mexico.
{57136}{57182}Of course.
{57234}{57277}Actually,|that was the one mission
{57279}{57319}we never accomplished.
{57321}{57343}Ingrid...
{57345}{57407}don't start|with your parents again.
{57408}{57459}It's funny|you should mention them.
{57461}{57542}No. When I mention your|parents, it is the exact|opposite of funny.
{57543}{57605}- Doesn't it bother|you that we never got|their full blessing?
{57607}{57669}- Frankly, you deserve another|chance to show them|- All right, all right.
{57671}{57735}Invite them if you want,|but I won't be here.
{57736}{57805}Tell them that I had a...|I had to go on another mission,
{57807}{57872}that - that we're having|a little problem on the moon.
{57874}{57936}My father loves the moon.
{58079}{58154}You invited them already,|didn't you?
{58156}{58193}Mm... define "invite."
{58195}{58222}Donnagon: Cortezes.
{58224}{58247}What?
{58249}{58328}I have some bad news.|May I come in?
{58353}{58377}- Certainly, sir.|- Yes, sir.
{58378}{58415}- Great.
{58580}{58624}Here he is.
{58802}{58858}Two of|our Spy Kid operatives
{58860}{58902}- Are lost|on the Ukata assignment.
{58904}{58935}Your children had|that assignment.
{58937}{58972}I'm so sorry, Donnagon.|How can we help?
{58974}{59028}Actually,|my children are safe
{59029}{59103}somewhere in the Gobi Desert,|I believe.
{59105}{59157}Uh, I'm sorry to say|that Carmen and Juni
{59159}{59226}are somehow the ones|on the Ukata assignment
{59227}{59265}a computing error|of some kind.
{59267}{59302}- Communications?|- None.
{59304}{59347}Their DragonSpy ship|doesn't show up
{59348}{59387}on radar or satellite.
{59389}{59423}- Greg, lngrid,
{59425}{59489}you guys risked your lives|once before to save me.
{59491}{59525}Let me go now
{59527}{59612}and personally bring|your children back.
{59612}{59641}No. Thank you.
{59643}{59676}Thank you, Donnagon,
{59678}{59735}but, respectfully,|we have to do this ourselves.
{59737}{59789}- If you could provide|tactical backup
{59790}{59838}and surveillance support|of our efforts,
{59840}{59870}we'll leave immediately.
{59872}{59913}Okay, yeah.
{60099}{60155}Uh, lngrid...
{60157}{60243}I know this may be|a bad time, but, um...
{60252}{60310}Your parents are here.
{60792}{60844}- But you guys told me|you were coming next Tuesday.
{60846}{60895}This is a very dangerous|assignment,
{60896}{60933}and you have to wait here.
{60935}{60963}Well, we want to help.
{60965}{61029}- Don't worry.
{61031}{61081}You taught me|everything I know.
{61083}{61131}Yes...
{61133}{61224}but not everything we know.
{61226}{61274}Of course not, Dad.|See you in a few hours.
{61276}{61325}- Thanks, honey.
{61611}{61670}I still don't like him.
{61726}{61729}Juni...
{61729}{61778}Juni...
{61780}{61838}was that there before?
{61909}{61996}That wasn't there|a minute ago, was it?
{61997}{62061}Are you kicking me?
{62063}{62094}I'm way over here!
{62095}{62193}I felt something|against my foot.
{62194}{62276}There's something under me!|Come look!
{62291}{62334}I don't see anything, Juni.
{62336}{62425}Let's just concentrate|on getting to shore.
{62455}{62520}Okay, it's about 200 yards.
{62520}{62609}- If we kick steadily|at one foot per kick,
{62609}{62673}we'll reach it in, um...
{62675}{62768}- 25 minutes?
{62769}{62816}- I don't know.
{62817}{62882}My calculator|doesn't work.
{62951}{62987}Juni, what did you do?
{62989}{63046}The air's coming|out of our suits!
{63048}{63115}We're heading towards shore!
{63458}{63513}"Travel heavy"!
{63562}{63603}Good idea!
{63605}{63642}All right.
{63644}{63700}Give it a rest.
{63734}{63801}Okay, we're gonna set up|a campsite,
{63803}{63875}put up the tent,|build a little fire.
{63877}{63936}And roast marshmallows?
{64095}{64133}I can't believe this!
{64135}{64171}What happened?
{64173}{64218}- Nothing - that's just it.
{64220}{64260}That was supposed to make|an instant campfire,
{64262}{64298}and that was supposed to make|a shelter.
{64326}{64379}None of our gadgets work.
{64380}{64450}You mean we have to use|our heads?
{64452}{64491}Yes.
{64684}{64735}Big office...
{64782}{64881}Director|of the O.S.S.'s office.
{64883}{64939}Big.
{65405}{65451}Did you find the source|of equal or greater power?
{65453}{65498}It emanates from the north side|of the island.
{65500}{65531}Have you located|the Island Man?
{65533}{65576}He's somewhere underground.
{65578}{65664}Yeah, well, start digging.|I'm on my way.
{65873}{65922}Come on, Juni.
{65924}{65962}Let's go check out the island.
{65964}{65999}I just set up camp.
{66001}{66032}See?
{66112}{66148}Sure wish Gary was here.
{66150}{66244}He'd want to find out|who was behind all this.
{66329}{66400}Aw, man!
{66402}{66463}All right, let's go.
{66541}{66590}Wow!
{66592}{66654}This place is amazing!
{66655}{66710}Check out that rock!
{66740}{66796}Looks like a hot dog.
{66820}{66921}Well, I've seen enough.|Let's go back to the beach.
{66925}{66958}What?
{66960}{66995}Listen.
{66995}{67072}- I hear something humming.
{67168}{67200}Somebody here has power.
{67202}{67282}We need to find out who|and for what.
{67324}{67371}- Destination - Ukata.
{67372}{67476}Estimated time of arrival...|one minute and counting.
{67511}{67569}How fast are we going?
{67576}{67606}85 knots.
{67608}{67667}Well... go faster.
{67669}{67715}With pleasure.
{67769}{67814}Faster.
{67880}{67947}Faster.
{67948}{67988}Can't go faster.
{67989}{68016}Faster.
{68018}{68050}I broke the fast thingy.
{68076}{68111}Faster!
{68333}{68389}- All right...
{68391}{68439}now what?
{68514}{68590}This is terrific.
{68592}{68630}You know,|this is just great.
{68632}{68678}You really did it|this time, Gerti.
{68679}{68732}Are you kicking me?
{68732}{68818}- No. I'm way over here,|cheese ball.
{69482}{69530}I'm gonna zap that sucker|to bits!
{69532}{69589}- Come here!
{69702}{69735}Wait!
{69781}{69819}- Save it for the Cortezes.
{69821}{69848}Yeah...
{69850}{69956}Excellent idea.
{69958}{69959}I don't get it!|I saw it go through this wall.
{69959}{70027}I don't get it!|I saw it go through this wall.
{70029}{70076}What's your assessment, Juni?
{70078}{70161}I'd think better|with food in my belly.
{70163}{70215}I think we should go up there|and check it out.
{70217}{70261}Up there...|to the top of the volcano?
{70262}{70293}Yep.
{70295}{70358}Not even if my micrograpplers|were working.
{70360}{70396}Gary would be brave enough|to do it.
{70398}{70430}Nope.
{70432}{70515}Nothing you can say|can change my mind.
{70585}{70664}- What did you just say?|- I didn't.
{70714}{70772}- Race you to the top!
{71190}{71233}Ah. Volcano.
{71263}{71333}Juni, stay back.
{71374}{71444}It's not active.
{71506}{71538}Juni!
{71635}{71680}What are you waiting for?
{71681}{71717}Get me out of here!
{71719}{71777}If my|auto retractor was working,
{71779}{71819}I'd get us both|back up there!
{71821}{71898}Uh. Okay.|I'm gonna grab your hand.
{72020}{72052}Okay.
{72165}{72209}My cellphone!
{72254}{72297}Why'd you stop?
{72297}{72325}- Something wrong?
{72327}{72359}Close your eyes.
{72361}{72403}Why?
{72477}{72503}Juni!
{72505}{72531}What?
{72532}{72576}I'm sorry!
{72949}{73010}How long|have we been falling?
{73012}{73049}I don't know.
{73050}{73105}My watch doesn't tell time.
{73107}{73148}Best guess?
{73150}{73214}I'd say about three hours.
{73214}{73268}Feels like four.
{73547}{73619}How could you be eating|at a time like this?
{73621}{73687}You know that tickling sensation|you get when you fall?
{73689}{73715}Of course.
{73716}{73813}That pretty much went away|after the first hour.
{73937}{73990}What happened?
{73992}{74060}I don't know!|We're floating!
{74119}{74165}Who are you?
{74166}{74220}- Do you see something?|- Over there, hiding.
{74222}{74251}What do you want?
{74252}{74291}I want to get down.
{74293}{74375}I'm Carmen Cortez,|special agent of the O.S.S.
{74377}{74407}I'm Romero,
{74409}{74508}sole inhabitant|of this island of Leeke Leeke...
{74546}{74623}... sole human inhabitant,|that is.
{74625}{74657}And you are?
{74659}{74696}Tired and hungry.
{74698}{74775}Nice to meet you,|Tired and Hungry.
{74799}{74848}- Careful! You'll crush my island!
{74850}{74885}Sorry.
{74887}{74951}We just fell four hours.|We're a little clumsy right now.
{74953}{75038}You weren't falling.|It was an illusion.
{75093}{75136}Magic?
{75241}{75281}Science.
{75370}{75449}Quickly,|we must get somewhere safe!
{75651}{75695}I'm a genetic specialist.
{75697}{75773}I needed a controlled|environment for my experiments.
{75775}{75829}The creatures|we've been hearing?
{75830}{75884}My experiments...
{75886}{75919}run amok.
{75921}{75967}What happened?
{76057}{76105}I thought I would make|a fortune from it.
{76106}{76176}Kids everywhere would have|their own miniature zoos,
{76177}{76244}- Right there|in their bedrooms.
{76246}{76310}A miniature zoo?
{76312}{76398}God's creatures...|on a manageable scale.
{76549}{76600}Unbelievable.
{76601}{76662}I called it|"Romero's Zoo"...
{76664}{76719}- Genetically miniaturized|animals.
{76721}{76796}Lions, tigers, bears,|penguins...
{76858}{76895}Monkeys.
{76929}{76967}Monkeys in a barrel.
{76969}{77006}Careful.
{77023}{77060}Careful.
{77156}{77196}One day,|I accidentally mixed up
{77198}{77240}two or three|different test tubes
{77242}{77327}and created|a new species... altogether.
{77531}{77610}Romero's Zoo Too...
{77611}{77705}an entirely new...|miniature zoo...
{77706}{77774}- Where each species|is unlike
{77775}{77838}any creature|you've ever seen.
{77840}{77880}Horse-fly?
{77935}{77982}Uh... cat-fish.
{78012}{78058}Spider-monkey?
{78100}{78140}Bull-frog.
{78157}{78180}Uh...
{78182}{78209}slizzards.
{78211}{78264}- Whoa.|- Stay away from those.
{78266}{78321}- And so, I started to think,
{78323}{78411}- "lf only I could make|them all a wee bit bigger,"
{78413}{78495}You know, for kids|with meatier hands.
{78547}{78602}That's where things went|very wrong.
{78604}{78644}I applied a growth serum,
{78645}{78719}and they took to it|all too well.
{78900}{78932}N-N-No!
{78934}{78997}No!
{78999}{79088}And I've been locked up|in here ever since.
{79106}{79180}I'm afraid to go|out there again.
{79222}{79312}They've tried to gobble me up|on more than one occasion.
{79314}{79389}Why do they despise me so?
{79391}{79448}I created them.
{79516}{79563}Do you think...
{79564}{79618}God stays in Heaven
{79620}{79680}because he, too,|lives in fear
{79682}{79726}of what he's created...
{79728}{79776}here on Earth?
{79778}{79856}Stop looking at me like that.
{79858}{79890}I'm no loon.
{79891}{79922}What I'm still trying|to figure out
{79924}{79967}is why this island|doesn't show up
{79969}{80016}on even|our most advanced satellites.
{80018}{80094}I created a cloaking|device to shield my island|from curious eyes.
{80095}{80164}Anything electronically|powered that comes|within a mile radius
{80166}{80196}instantly shuts down.
{80197}{80260}Any radar that passes|over me is displaced,
{80262}{80335}creating the illusion|that my island doesn't exist.
{80337}{80381}The Transmooker device.
{80383}{80424}How did you know?
{80426}{80473}Your cloaking device|is highly coveted.
{80475}{80581}People everywhere are trying|to get their hands on it.
{80624}{80721}Are you sure|we're the only humans here?
{80839}{80872}There they are
{80874}{80934}two children,|judging by their size.
{80936}{80969}What is this?
{80971}{81042}It's a miniature|of the island.
{81110}{81172}The center point of|the volcano provides|a gravitational basis
{81174}{81237}for which|my miniature creatures
{81239}{81299}can line up exactly|to their larger|clone counterparts.
{81301}{81372}- So, wherever your miniature|creatures are on this model,
{81373}{81421}it's where the bigger ones|are outside?
{81422}{81495}Correct. I can keep track|of their whereabouts this way.
{81497}{81542}- See?
{81543}{81606}The two intruder children are|being chased by a slizzard.
{81607}{81638}- Gary and Gerti.|- Leave'em.
{81640}{81681}We have to go help them!
{81682}{81740}They shouldn't be|snooping around my|island to begin with!
{81742}{81796}- I'm with you, dude.|- We have to help them.
{81798}{81881}I'm not going out there!|I'll be eaten!
{81918}{82006}What a bizarre man.
{82007}{82059}- Help us!|- Help!
{82059}{82091}Somebody!
{82093}{82121}What are you guys doing|down there?
{82123}{82152}That's real funny, clown.|Get us out!
{82154}{82213}We tried to activate|our micrograpplers,
{82214}{82249}but they didn't deploy!
{82251}{82289}Nothing works here.
{82290}{82357}Yeah, we know that now.|Thanks for the update,|carrot top.
{82358}{82421}- Juni, come back.|They need our help.|- I'll help them.
{82423}{82478}I want to get him|back over here
{82480}{82545}so I can push him|back over myself.
{82546}{82577}- Hurry up.|- Come on.
{82579}{82617}Here, Gary.
{82618}{82667}Gimme your hand.
{82691}{82743}Thank you, Carmen.
{82835}{82864}Here, Gerti...
{82866}{82912}gimme your hand.
{82914}{82956}Just wait|till my father gets here.
{82958}{83022}Your father's coming?
{83111}{83170}Where are you|taking me now, Carmen?
{83172}{83209}Hold on.
{83318}{83386}Why are you still hiding?|We're kids, not monsters.
{83388}{83409}What's the difference?
{83411}{83475}Relax.|They're O.S.S. agents, as well.
{83477}{83524}- Level one.|- They're Donnagon's kids.
{83526}{83562}Agent Donnagon?
{83564}{83599}You work for the O.S.S.,|don't you?
{83601}{83642}I work|for a man named Donnagon.
{83644}{83669}Who is this guy?
{83671}{83743}- Donnagon's not interested|in your creatures.|- Why not?
{83744}{83785}The Transmooker device|that hides your island
{83787}{83817}that's what Donnagon|really wants.
{83819}{83869}That's not nearly|as interesting.
{83871}{83915}Now that Donnagon's head|of the O.S.S.,
{83916}{83965}he has the power|to take it from you.
{83967}{84006}What are you babbling|about now, Juni?
{84007}{84041}The Transmooker you took
{84042}{84089}from the president's|daughter, Gary.
{84090}{84123}It was just a prototype.
{84124}{84175}The real Transmooker device|is here on this island.
{84177}{84210}It's even more powerful
{84212}{84253}and can shut down|all technology on the planet.
{84255}{84293}You said|your father's on his way.
{84295}{84337}I think he's coming|to pick it up.
{84339}{84374}You're all liars.
{84375}{84436}Do you really think you're|gonna turn us on our own father?
{84438}{84485}Did your dad tell you|the mission you went on
{84487}{84541}was just a setup|for Carmen and me?
{84543}{84577}- Why not?|- He has his reasons.
{84578}{84637}That's what being a good spy|is all about
{84639}{84683}trust no one.
{84684}{84739}How to Be a Spy...|we've read it.
{84741}{84777}Well, read it again.
{84779}{84841}A good spy makes|no binding connections|with family or friends.
{84843}{84890}Well, I don't believe|in that - do you?
{84892}{84951}If you want to be a good spy,|you better believe it.
{84953}{85026}My father's a great spy,|so let's grow up, shall we?
{85028}{85066}Whatever my father's done,
{85068}{85110}it's what it takes to play|in the big world...
{85112}{85163}Iike it or not.
{85165}{85227}Come on, Gerti.|Let's go.
{85228}{85266}He's right.
{85267}{85334}Oh! Why can't you side with me|just once?
{85335}{85388}There are no sides...|you're right,|and he's right, too.
{85390}{85440}That's what|being a spy means.
{85442}{85474}Well, I don't like it.
{85476}{85510}- Then quit.|- I will.
{85512}{85555}Yeah, right.
{85985}{86026}- Donnagon was right...
{86027}{86098}- Their DragonSpy doesn't|show up anywhere on radar.
{86100}{86183}I am not interested|in finding the sub.
{86229}{86265}Remember that year
{86267}{86343}I insisted on doing the|children's dental work... myself?
{86345}{86389}How could I forget?
{86391}{86436}Well...
{86438}{86504}I installed|a nonelectrical tracking device
{86506}{86533}in their teeth
{86535}{86574}my own invention.
{86576}{86638}But I haven't been able|to test it,
{86640}{86684}until...
{86685}{86717}now.
{86765}{86806}- Honey, it works!|- Whoa...
{86808}{86873}Hard to believe.
{86875}{86936}But according to this...
{86945}{87017}They're in|the middle of the ocean.
{87019}{87049}Above sea level.
{87051}{87135}But where they are on the map,|there's no land mass.
{87137}{87197}- How can that be?
{87249}{87287}Now what?
{87324}{87377}Something's got us.
{87900}{87949}- Aaah!|- What is it?
{87951}{88002}Your mother.
{88003}{88067}- Mom?|- We wanted to join you.
{88069}{88104}Are you nuts?
{88105}{88147}We needed a bigger boat.
{88149}{88192}And we brought real food
{88194}{88287}none of that freeze-dried stuff|you think's so chic.
{88288}{88333}- Son-in-law.|- Yeah?
{88335}{88372}Make yourself useful.
{88374}{88408}Why are you here?
{88409}{88501}We wanted to help|get our grandchildren back!
{88529}{88586}We will get|our grandchildren back.
{88587}{88626}Gracias.|Oh, wait.
{88628}{88678}- You've got something|on your lip.|- What?
{88680}{88728}- Got it.
{88730}{88775}Uh, Mom...
{88777}{88866}Dad, I am a big girl now,|and I can take care|of myself, okay?
{88867}{88926}And Gregorio and l,|we can take care of|finding our children.
{88928}{88982}No, you don't seem|to understand.
{88984}{89078}This isn't you and Gregorio|simply saving the world again.
{89079}{89167}This time, we all have much more|to lose if you fail
{89169}{89212}Carmen and Juni.
{89214}{89260}You cannot come with us.
{89262}{89301}It is too dangerous.
{89303}{89399}Oh, you mean,|we can't handle ourselves,
{89634}{89693}May I have|my moustache back...
{89694}{89735}please?
{89765}{89842}If Donnagon really is|on his way...
{89867}{89955}... we have to destroy|the Transmooker.
{89957}{89993}Where is it?
{89995}{90076}The other side of the island.|Not easy to get to.
{90078}{90117}The journey alone
{90119}{90181}is more dangerous than|the Transmooker itself.
{90183}{90223}- I made sure of it.
{90225}{90263}Show us.
{90265}{90326}You're not going out there,|are you?
{90328}{90383}We don't have much choice,|do we?
{90385}{90420}With those monsters|running around?
{90421}{90463}I don't believe|they're monsters.
{90464}{90501}Maybe you shouldn't, either.
{90502}{90554}- Well, what should I believe?|- I don't know.
{90556}{90592}You're always in here hiding.
{90594}{90641}Maybe they|just wanna be with you.
{90642}{90671}Be with me?
{90673}{90720}They wanna be picking me|out of their teeth,
{90722}{90751}is what they wanna be.
{90752}{90803}You just gotta show them|who's boss.
{90805}{90857}You're not afraid?
{90873}{90944}First thing|you gotta do is...
{90984}{91043}... fall into this pit.
{91110}{91153}How does it work?
{91155}{91235}Supposedly,|they're run magnetically.
{91261}{91359}We should be able to ride over|a determined path.
{91564}{91638}We have to get the Transmooker|before they do.
{91640}{91678}Right.
{91881}{91921}Slizzards.
{91921}{91969}Oh, no.
{92188}{92232}This is cool.
{92388}{92410}Juni!
{92412}{92451}Juni!
{92453}{92512}- I think we should|get off now.
{92514}{92539}Why?
{92540}{92578}Trust me!
{92635}{92680}Jump now!
{92892}{92939}Gary and Gerti.
{92939}{93018}I told you|they were following us.
{93180}{93232}You have one new message.
{93234}{93264}Message one...
{93266}{93315}Hello, Alexandra,|it's me
{93316}{93352}agent Juni Cortez.
{93354}{93391}I'm on a mission...
{93392}{93435}I know I shouldn't be.
{93436}{93504}But I had an idea|for you and your father.
{93506}{93552}Simply tell him|you need to talk to him.
{93554}{93613}Tell him it's nothing urgent,
{93615}{93670}but someday|it might be urgent.
{93672}{93756}And you need to open the|communication lines right now.
{93758}{93815}So give me a call.|Love to hear from you.
{93817}{93851}And right now it's about
{93853}{93917}Silly me, I forgot my watch|doesn't tell time.
{93919}{93962}Heh.|And, uh
{93976}{94019}Something's wrong.|Take the wheel.
{94020}{94067}Gotta go. Good luck!
{94067}{94144}- Juni!|- Computer: End of message.
{94249}{94338}- Gregorio, the signal requires|that you go around it.|- He won't listen to you.
{94340}{94410}- He won't listen to you,|Mother.|- Choose another directi
{94412}{94495}- He wants to make sure|he loses the children again.
{94497}{94555}If you would only listen to us|and do what we're saying
{94557}{94598}you're tracking them|all wrong.
{94600}{94656}Ingrid, tell him|he's tracking them all wrong.
{94658}{94702}Mom, Dad,|I have told you before,
{94704}{94764}and I will tell you again...|no backseat driving.
{94766}{94854}- Thank you.|- When Gregorio is at the wheel,|no one tells him what to do.
{94896}{94946}Turn here, honey.
{94968}{94990}Sorry.
{94992}{95028}Okay.
{95030}{95125}- You're sure you're|reading that map correctly?
{95125}{95173}The coordinates correspond
{95175}{95248}to Carmen and Juni's|current position.
{95250}{95292}These are my children.
{95293}{95360}And I will find them my way!
{95390}{95418}Blah, blah, blah.
{95420}{95480}I never understand|a single word he's saying.
{95481}{95511}Never.
{95513}{95550}Not only were we set up,
{95552}{95608}but I bet Donnagon|knew all along
{95610}{95692}that you'd hack your way|into taking this assignment.
{95694}{95766}I was wondering|the same thing.
{95810}{95840}Juni, open up.
{95842}{95880}What?
{95882}{95991}- Dad installed these trackers|in case we ever got lost.
{96111}{96189}Hurry. Take mine out.
{96191}{96255}And why are we doing this?
{96358}{96407}When we get lost,|who saves us?
{96409}{96452}Mom and Dad.
{96453}{96494}Now, if Mom and Dad|also disappear,
{96496}{96561}who's gonna stop Donnagon from|using the Transmooker device?
{96563}{96600}Donnagon wants us|all together
{96602}{96658}so he can destroy the island|and all of us with it.
{96660}{96728}Mom and Dad - even Romero.
{96730}{96799}We can't let Mom and Dad|find us...
{96801}{96853}or Donnagon wins.
{96855}{96924}- A big sacrifice.
{96925}{96980}Family is sacrifice.
{97082}{97115}What happened?
{97117}{97191}What did...|what did you just do?
{97258}{97305}We lost Carmen.
{97339}{97401}- A-And Juni?
{97402}{97458}Juni's still on-line.
{97502}{97553}I love you.
{97653}{97707}That can't be.
{97752}{97843}- Okay, okay.|What do we do?
{97949}{97993}I don't know.
{98235}{98267}Maybe this is like
{98269}{98329}the mission of the spies|who didn't want to be found.
{98359}{98390}You know...
{98391}{98455}if they|don't want to be found,
{98457}{98536}maybe their position|is compromised.
{98715}{98839}Now, Gregorio, don't tell me|you didn't have a backup plan.
{98867}{98958}Ingrid, was Juni wearing|that charm necklace
{98959}{99028}I sent him for Christmas|last year?
{99030}{99075}He never takes it off.
{99076}{99104}Then we got him.
{99105}{99214}I was worried about|Juni's well-being,
{99216}{99357}so I put a tracer|in his necklace.
{99385}{99423}There he is.
{99425}{99459}Thanks, Dad.
{99461}{99529}Are you sure you don't want me|to take over the wheel?
{99530}{99558}I - that's funny.
{99560}{99619}- It's funny.
{99804}{99848}Back to work.
{99850}{99894}Where are we?
{99894}{99922}Well...
{99924}{100016}not far from|the antechamber.
{100017}{100078}I think it's behind us.
{100262}{100287}Don't move.
{100289}{100344}Maybe it's friendly.
{100382}{100432}Maybe it's not.
{100469}{100522}Let's go!
{100907}{100947}It's an underwater cave.
{100949}{101005}We'll have to go|all the way around.
{101006}{101051}That'll take all day.
{101053}{101111}There must be a faster
{101448}{101496}Wow...
{101497}{101564}What is this place?
{101636}{101708}Do you think|that's real gold?
{101710}{101761}Gross!
{101763}{101824}This is so slimy.
{101825}{101872}I hate mold.
{101874}{101920}I can hear your thoughts.
{101922}{101958}What?
{101960}{102004}And you can hear mine!
{102006}{102044}Our mouths aren't moving,
{102046}{102104}but we can hear|what we're thinking.
{102106}{102152}Say something.
{102199}{102266}How strange.
{102268}{102336}We can only communicate|by thought.
{102338}{102375}- Magic.
{102375}{102412}Think something.
{102413}{102471}Um... your feet stink.
{102507}{102562}I wonder.
{102710}{102800}Okay, this place|is really weird.
{102801}{102828}Let's go.
{102830}{102876}Good thinking.
{102982}{103066}Now, this is more like it.
{103068}{103149}Treasure.
{103229}{103277}Skeletons.
{103279}{103336}Dead skeletons.
{103338}{103399}Is there any other kind?
{103535}{103662}This must've been where|the pirate prisoners|and treasure were kept.
{103871}{103946}This must've been|a pretty special necklace
{103948}{104002}for them to die|fighting over it.
{104004}{104058}One necklace|to rule them all
{104059}{104088}Put it back, Juni!
{104089}{104123}I didn't take it yet.
{104125}{104176}I can read your mind,|remember?
{104178}{104232}This land|is ancient and cursed.
{104234}{104293}If you take anything,|you'll doom us both.
{104294}{104340}Let's go!
{105011}{105077}Come on!|I think I found a way out.
{105079}{105112}Which way?
{105113}{105182}I don't know, you pick...|right or left?
{105184}{105237}Right.
{105344}{105391}Wait a minute.
{105393}{105418}Oh, no!
{105420}{105480}We went in a circle.
{105482}{105505}What?
{105507}{105530}Come on.
{105532}{105585}Let's try it again.
{105629}{105703}Come on, Juni!|I know what we did wrong.
{105704}{105777}We've gotta go left.
{105834}{105884}Maybe I should|put this back.
{105886}{105909}Uh-oh.
{105911}{105979}Where are|the dead skeletons?
{106173}{106222}Carmen!
{106433}{106477}Juni!
{106604}{106651}Help me!
{106866}{106912}Hey, bonehead!
{106965}{106993}Wh
{107100}{107158}Oh, no.
{107319}{107357}Why is this happening?
{107359}{107403}I don't know!
{107537}{107561}Wait a minute!
{107562}{107615}You took something,|didn't you?
{107616}{107681}No!|Y-Y-You told me not to!
{107695}{107738}Why would l?
{107795}{107852}Juni!
{107854}{107889}Carmen!
{108079}{108111}Wait.
{108235}{108275}I'm sorry.
{108490}{108526}Carmen!
{108528}{108589}Carmen!
{108764}{108807}You too,
{108808}{108845}Yeah.
{108875}{108931}Where's your brother?
{108932}{108952}Did he get eaten?
{108954}{109050}No. He's out there|looking for Juni.
{109052}{109111}You know he squashed|Juni's bug on purpose.
{109112}{109161}Yeah, I know.
{109163}{109210}Now he wants to squash Juni.
{109212}{109300}Don't you think|we should get out of here?
{109426}{109535}Carmen!
{109537}{109576}I'm dreaming.
{109578}{109641}I am totally dreaming.
{109694}{109759}And I'm hungry, too.
{110078}{110142}You like honey-roasted ham|and potatoes, don't you?
{110144}{110199}- That's what flavor this is.
{110201}{110253}Highly nutritious.
{110253}{110339}Packed with protein|and essential carbs.
{110434}{110511}Everything|a growing centaur needs.
{110524}{110571}You're welcome.
{110767}{110849}Well, well, well.|Your friend likes freeze-dried.
{110850}{110894}So does mine.
{111129}{111215}All right, buddy.|Let's kick their butts.
{111230}{111279}- Heh heh heh.|We're waiting.
{111281}{111318}Come on.
{111319}{111414}- Can't let you bust up|my dad's machine, Juni.
{111476}{111534}So I guess I'll just have to|bust you up.
{111535}{111564}We can take'em.
{111566}{111612}Come on, buddy.|We can take'em.
{111614}{111711}I don't think|we can take'em!
{111827}{111886}Must try and help them.
{111896}{111932}Must.
{111934}{111995}So, even if your dad is|behind all this,
{111997}{112063}you'd still side with him|over what's right?
{112065}{112131}Right? How do you ever know|what's right?
{112133}{112160}Trust me,
{112161}{112238}when the moment comes,|you'll know.
{112340}{112405}I think that moment's come.
{112630}{112672}Come on!
{112674}{112745}Show'em who's boss.
{112747}{112809}Show'em who's boss.
{112811}{112855}I'm the boss.
{112970}{113010}I'm the...
{113362}{113406}- Look out!
{113475}{113525}Forward, go, man.
{113725}{113782}Come on, spidey.|You can do it.
{113783}{113831}- Yeah!
{114146}{114207}Your creature's lame.
{114209}{114264}So are you, lame-o.
{114266}{114311}It's all over|for you, squirt.
{114313}{114414}Too bad your dork sister's|not here to cheer me on.
{114463}{114507}- Hey!
{114632}{114679}Ya-a-a-a-a-a-h!
{115164}{115211}I don't want to hurt you,|Carmen.
{115213}{115293}You're so full|of shiitake mushrooms.
{115373}{115428}Put it down, Carmen.
{115465}{115508}Put it down.
{115672}{115722}Okay.
{115724}{115791}All right.
{115793}{115842}Gerti,|a little assistance here.
{115844}{115900}Don't look at me, brother.|You're fighting a girl.
{115902}{115954}You're gonna lose.
{116065}{116114}I'm siding with you.
{116116}{116159}Thanks.
{116161}{116214}But just this once.
{116338}{116376}Cortezes.
{116567}{116629}You gonna help me or not?
{117175}{117232}Well, there it is.
{117234}{117287}How do you know?
{117289}{117374}'Cause it's big and weird|and in the middle of the room.
{117376}{117417}Good point.
{117602}{117627}Careful, Juni!
{117629}{117665}If you don't|shut it down right,
{117667}{117711}you can bring the entire world|to an end.
{117713}{117738}Thanks.
{117739}{117766}I'm serious.
{117768}{117838}Well, we have to|shut it down.
{117851}{117906}This turns that off.
{117931}{117992}And that turns this off.
{118032}{118141}He said there's something tricky|about the third switch.
{118192}{118232}Let's see.
{118256}{118319}Too late, Gary.|We got here first.
{118321}{118367}Just stand up against the wall|like a good boy
{118369}{118399}and leave us alone.
{118400}{118489}Nice try, but we brought|friends this time.
{118498}{118523}Romero.
{118525}{118572}What are you doing|outside of your cage?
{118573}{118620}I have no idea.
{118675}{118700}Donnagon.
{118702}{118735}Hello, agents.
{118737}{118793}Warming it up for me?
{118804}{118872}Are you ready to cooperate|this time, Romero?
{118874}{118908}- I...|- Good.
{118910}{119015}This should be pain...|and simple.
{119075}{119111}What did you do?
{119113}{119151}He started the Transmooker!
{119152}{119215}You said three switches.
{119217}{119289}The entire world|will shut down instantly.
{119291}{119325}Good going, cheese ball.
{119326}{119357}What do we do?
{119359}{119457}You must bind together|the three toggle switches.
{119518}{119556}It won't stay up!
{119558}{119609}- Machete elastic wonder!|- Machete elastic wonder!
{119611}{119658}Here - grab it!
{119790}{119849}Give it to me.|Give it!
{119851}{119881}Dad...
{119883}{119929}Give it to me.
{119944}{119993}Give it to me...
{120030}{120073}... or else.
{120073}{120132}Give it to him, Carmen.
{120275}{120300}Where'd it go?
{120301}{120334}Where'd it go?
{120336}{120370}I don't know.
{120372}{120407}The spork took it.
{120408}{120471}Back to its... nest.
{120500}{120539}I know|where the nest is, Dad.
{120569}{120640}I also have Romero's|instruction book.
{120642}{120669}Hey.
{120671}{120711}Brat.
{120713}{120759}Come on!
{121097}{121165}It's just over that big hill.
{121195}{121265}Are you sure this is|the right way?
{121266}{121325}My watch has a GPS satellite,|you dope.
{121327}{121360}Wait a minute.
{121362}{121396}How can this be?
{121398}{121439}When you took out|the Transmooker,
{121441}{121489}the island cloaking device|was shut down.
{121491}{121562}Then what are we doing|on foot?
{121565}{121616}Later, Romero.
{121950}{121973}There it is!
{121975}{122015}Get up there, Dad!|Come on!
{122017}{122051}Okay, Magna Men,
{122052}{122139}we're gonna need a human ladder|starting right... here.
{122141}{122179}- Carmen!
{122379}{122401}What?
{122403}{122486}An agent's only as good|as her gadgets.
{122688}{122758}They're heading|for the beach.
{122993}{123035}Help!
{123390}{123449}The kid was right.
{123939}{123987}- What are you doing?
{123989}{124030}Trying to remote-pilot|our submarine to the surface
{124032}{124065}so we can get out of here.
{124066}{124160}Get on your GPS|and see where Mom and Dad are.
{124201}{124234}This can't be right.
{124236}{124322}This shows that|they're right next to us.
{124446}{124481}Oh, no!
{124481}{124532}That's no way|to greet your grandparents.
{124534}{124564}Come on.
{124566}{124596}Grandpa!
{124598}{124658}Ah, Juni.
{124660}{124716}Come here, come here.
{124769}{124860}Always take this with you|wherever you go,
{124862}{124909}and I'll always be there.
{124911}{124964}I promise, Grandpa.
{124981}{125025}Not you guys!
{125036}{125080}You don't want to be rescued.
{125082}{125125}You don't want to be saved.
{125127}{125163}That's all right.
{125165}{125219}We thought you might...|you might need us.
{125221}{125261}Go talk to your father.
{125263}{125306}- Dad!|- Hey, Mom.
{125308}{125356}- Come on, Dad. Look at me.|- Two spies|who didn't want to be found?
